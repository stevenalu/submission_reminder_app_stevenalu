# ðŸš€ Submission Reminder App ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Submission Reminder App** repository by **[stevenalu](https://github.com/stevenalu)**!

This project is an exciting shell script application that automates the setup of an environment to send assignment reminders. It shows off the power of Bash scripting, a good project structure, and modular design.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Automated Setup:** A shell script (`create_environment.sh`) that creates a neatly organized project folder.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Customize the app using the configuration file (`config/config.env`).
- **Intelligent Reminders:** The app checks a list of student submissions (`assets/submissions.txt`) and reminds those who haven't submitted.
- **Modular Code:** Uses helper functions (`modules/functions.sh`) for clean and reusable code.
